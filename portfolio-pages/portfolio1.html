            <h1>What is Computer Science?</h1>
            <p>The discipline known as Computer Science is generally well known throughout the masses as a study of computer hardware and software designs. 
                Though it is true, there is more to it, however.</p>
            <p>Computer Science is the discipline that plants the foundation for a variety of subjects, namely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer design</li>
                <li>Computer programming</li>
                <li>Information processing</li>
                <li>Algorithm solutions and problems</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>History of the Field</h1>
            <p>Computer Science has been around for quite some time, with the discipline itself being born in the early 1940's. But there have been notable works that have occurred way before the birth of this field, that may have laid the dirt on the field we are in. The history of this discipline dates back to the 17th century, 
                but was taken more and more seriously during the early 20th century.</p>
            <p>The earliest note of a computer (or a machine rather) was in 1673, when Gottfried Leibniz created the “Stepped Reckoner”, a digital mechanical calculator. 
                Principally, he was considered to be the first computer scientist. </p>
            <p>The central idea of a computer came from Alan Turing in 1936, 
                when he created a computational machine that can compute anything, to which he called the “Turing Machine”.</p>

                <h1>Concepts in Computer Science</h1>
                <p>Computer Science, as a course, delves into the deep concepts needed to learn and master the skills needed for a job within the field. 
                    The earliest concepts learned in computer science include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Algorithms</li>
                    <li>Computer Languages and its Concepts</li>
                    <li>Data Storage</li>
                    <li>Computing and Conversion</li>
                    <li>Human-Computer Interaction</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>What does a Computer Scientist do?</h1>
                <p>Computer scientists work primarily with software systems. The term “computer scientist” is not a job, 
                    but the discipline itself can lead you to numerous career choices, including:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Scientist</li>
                    <li>Web Developer</li>
                    <li>Data Architect</li>
                </ul>
