                <h1>What is Computer Hardware?</h1>
                <p>Computer Hardware is the collective term that includes the physical parts of a computer. 
                    Computer hardware is one of the, if not the most important aspect of a computer system. 
                    It’s uses include taking input data from the user, storing the data, and displaying the output.</p>

                <p>Computer hardware can also be split into two categories, mainly input and output devices. 
                    Input devices are used by the user to input data to the computer system, and output devices are used to showcase or present the data to the user.</p>

                <h1>Input Devices</h1>

                <p>Input devices are hardware components that enable users to interact with computers by entering data, commands, or instructions for processing. 
                    These devices act as bridges between humans and machines, converting various types of input—like text, sound, gestures, or movements—into digital signals that a computer can understand and process.</p>
                <p>The versatility of input devices lies in their ability to cater to different types of interaction. 
                    Keyboards and mice, for instance, are standard tools for everyday computing, enabling precise control and text entry. 
                    Meanwhile, touchscreens have revolutionized interaction by allowing users to directly manipulate on-screen elements with their fingers or a stylus.</p>

                <h1>Output Devices</h1>

                <p>Output devices are hardware components that transform digital data processed by a computer into a format that humans can perceive and interpret. 
                    These devices serve as the bridge between a computer’s internal operations and the user’s understanding of the results, making abstract data comprehensible through visual, auditory, or physical means.</p>
                <p>Output devices are crucial in making computer systems user-friendly and functional, as they enable users to perceive and act on the processed information. 
                    Whether for personal use, professional tasks, or creative endeavors, these devices ensure that the results of computational processes are accessible, meaningful, and actionable. </p>

                <h1>System Software</h1>
                <p>System software is a fundamental category of computer software that directs and controls the functioning of a computer’s hardware while managing its internal and external resources. 
                    It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the user, ensuring that all components of the system work together efficiently and reliably.</p>
                <p>System software is indispensable for the seamless operation of a computer. 
                    It not only ensures the efficient use of hardware resources but also provides a stable platform for application software to run, making it the backbone of modern computing systems.</p>

                <h1>Application Software</h1>
                <p>Application software is a type of computer software designed to help users perform specific tasks or achieve particular goals. 
                    Unlike system software, which manages the underlying hardware and system operations, application software directly serves the user by providing functionality tailored to their needs. </p>
                <p>Modern application software often leverages cloud technology, enabling users to access programs and store data online. 
                    Tools like Google Workspace or Adobe Creative Cloud allow for seamless collaboration and integration across devices, reflecting the versatility and adaptability of application software.</p>
