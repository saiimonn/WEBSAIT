                <h1>What is a Motherboard?</h1>
                <p>Computer consist of a variety of components that are essential for its functionality.
                    One of the most important components of the computer is the motherboard.
                    A motherboard is a circuit system for the computer, and is also known to be the biggest part of the computer.
                    It distributes electricity and facilitates the communication between the different parts of the computer, additionally attaching them together in order to create a communication link between them.

                <h1>Functions of a Motherboard</h1>
                <p>The motherboard consists of other functions other than inter-component communication, it also ensures the compatibility of the different hardware components within it.
                    They also consist of ports that connect peripheral devices among other things such as USB devices, input devices, audio devices, etc.
                    And it manages the data flow using the Basic Input Output System or BIOS to ensure that the operating system interacts well with the input/outpu devices and to cuarantee that they can process instructions to the computer.
                    It is also important to note that motherboards are customizable, from removing or adding components such as RAM, GPU, CPU, to activating RGB lights to your hardware.

            <h1 class = "titlebar">Features of a Motherboard</h1>

            <section class = "horizontal-rectangle">

                <h1>Features</h1>
                
                <p><b>Form Factor</b> - The form factor of a motherboard refers to its physical size, shape, and layout, which determine its compatibility with computer cases and components. Standard form factors include ATX, Micro-ATX, and Mini-ITX, each catering to different build sizes and purposes. The form factor also dictates the placement of critical components such as CPU slots, memory slots, and connectors, ensuring that these components are accessible and efficiently arranged.</p>
                <p><b>CPU Slots</b> - The CPU slot (or socket) is the physical interface on the motherboard where the processor is installed. It allows the CPU to connect with the motherboard, enabling communication between the processor and other system components like memory and storage. Different CPU sockets support different types of processors, so compatibility is a key consideration when building or upgrading a system. </p>
                <p><b>Memory Slots</b> - Memory slots, also known as DIMM (Dual Inline Memory Module) slots, are physical connectors on the motherboard designed to house RAM modules. These slots enable users to expand the system’s memory capacity, which is essential for handling more data and running demanding applications efficiently. Modern motherboards typically feature two to four memory slots, and some high-end models offer up to eight.</p>
                <p><b>Chipsets</b> - The chipset is a crucial component of the motherboard, often referred to as its silicon backbone. It acts as a communication hub, connecting the CPU to other components such as storage drives, expansion cards, and input/output devices. A motherboard’s chipset determines its capabilities, including the number of USB ports, PCI slots, and SATA connections, as well as support for features like overclocking and RAID configurations. </p>
                <p><b>BIOS</b> - The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is firmware embedded in the motherboard that initializes the computer’s hardware during startup before the operating system loads. It performs a Power-On Self Test (POST) to check that essential components like memory, storage, and the CPU are functioning correctly. </p>
                <p><b>PCI Slots</b> - PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) slots are expansion slots on the motherboard that allow users to install various expansion cards, enhancing or adding to the computer’s functionality. Common PCI cards include graphics cards for improved visual performance, sound cards for high-quality audio, and network cards for advanced connectivity options.</p>
                <p><b>SATA</b> - SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is an interface standard used to connect storage devices, such as hard drives, solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives, to the motherboard. SATA connections are vital for data storage and retrieval, with modern SATA standards offering high-speed data transfer rates. </p>

                <h1>How do they differ?</h1>

                <p>The key differences among the various types of motherboards primarily lie in their size, expansion capabilities, and built-in features, which cater to different user needs and computing environments. Larger motherboards, such as ATX (Advanced Technology Extended), are designed for high-performance systems and offer extensive customization options. They typically feature more expansion slots, RAM slots, and connectivity options, making them ideal for gamers, professionals, and enthusiasts who require powerful systems capable of running demanding applications or supporting advanced graphics setups.</p>
                <p>The choice of motherboard also influences cooling potential and power delivery. Larger boards provide better airflow and support for more powerful components, while smaller boards may require innovative cooling solutions due to tighter spaces.</p>
