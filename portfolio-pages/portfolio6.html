                <h1>What is a Computer?</h1>

                <p>
                    Computers are an essential part of our livelihood in the 21st century. It serves a variety of uses, from education, communication, entertainment, and so much more. 
                    Almost everything we do in our daily lives include either a computer or a portable computer (cellphone). 
                    But this is just the general definition of a computer, as that’s the most understandable way of describing it to the majority of the human population. 
                    Computers, when researched thoroughly and extensively, have a wider definition behind it as well as an additional amount of its uses that we don’t know are happening as we use our devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Computers are mathematical machines that compute numbers (typically in binary) once it receives raw data and displays it in a desired format that is fitting to satisfy the user’s eyes. 
                    Computers consist of two main parts, which are hardware and software. 
                    Hardware is defined as the physical materials used within a computer in order for the computer to perform its tasks. 
                    Software is the program or code used to act as an algorithm for the computer to follow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In essence, computers are not just tools for performing everyday tasks—they are complex systems capable of performing extraordinary feats. 
                    Their evolution continues to redefine what is possible, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us.

                <h1>Supercomputers</h1>

                <p>
                    This is a type of computer which costs from 6 - 7 figures. 
                    Some are single computer systems while others are multiple high performance computers that work together as a single system. 
                    Supercomputers are the biggest as well as the fastest computers and are designed to process a gargantuan amount of data and process an unbelievable amount of data (trillions)  in a second. 
                    Supercomputers are mainly found in research centers, scientific institutions, or weather forecasting stations, typically any place that requires speed when it comes to computing as it is a vital concern.

                <h1>Mainframe Computers</h1>
                
                <p>
                    Traditionally, a mainframe is defined as a computer that is a centered computer link for other types of computers that are less powerful. 
                    This type of computer is designed to support thousands of users at the same time and execute different processes simultaneously. 
                    Mainframe computers are almost similar to supercomputers, but their only difference is the number of users they can assist. 
                    Mainframes can assist more users at the same time compared to supercomputers.

                <h1>Mini Computers</h1>

                <p>
                    A mini computer is a multiprocessing computer that is medium in size compared to the large sizes of a supercomputer and a mainframe computer. 
                    Also compared to the mainframe computer, a mini computer can support 4 - 200 users at a time, which is adequate for growing businesses. 
                    And unlike the aforementioned computers, a mini computer is smaller in comparison and is more light in terms of mass, which makes it easy to carry anywhere.
