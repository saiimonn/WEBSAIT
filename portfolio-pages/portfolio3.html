            <h1>What are Number Systems?</h1>

            <p>Number Systems are representations of number through the utilization of digits and symbols.</p>
            <p>The value of these digits are determined through their position and their base.
                The type of number systems include the following:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Binary</b></li>
                <li><b>Octal</b></li>
                <li><b>Decimal</b></li>

                <h1>Binary</h1>
                <p>The Binary Number System is one of the fundamental numbering systems in mathematics and computing. 
                    It is uniquely simple, as it uses only two digits, 0 and 1, to represent all values. 
                    This simplicity makes it ideal for electronic and computer systems, as these two states can easily correspond to physical phenomena like on/off, true/false, or high/low voltage.</p>

                <h1>Octal</h1>
                <p>The Octal Number System is a numbering system that uses eight digits, ranging from 0 to 7, to represent values. 
                    It is a base-8 system, meaning each position in an octal number corresponds to a power of 8, starting from 8^0 at the rightmost position. 
                    Octal is widely used in computing due to its close relationship with the binary system, making it both practical and efficient for certain applications.</p>

                <h1>Decimal</h1>
                <p>The Decimal Number System is the most commonly used numbering system in everyday life. 
                    It operates on a base-10 structure, meaning it uses ten unique digits, 0 through 9, to represent all possible numerical values. 
                    This system is inherently intuitive for humans, as it aligns with natural counting and measurement practices.</p>

                <h1>Hexadecimal</h1>
                <p>The Hexadecimal Number System is a numbering system that uses 16 unique symbols to represent values, combining the digits 0 to 9 and the letters A to F (where A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, and F = 15). 
                    As a base-16 system, hexadecimal is particularly important in computing due to its efficient representation of binary data.</p>
